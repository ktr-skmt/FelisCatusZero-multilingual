# Knowledge Source Installation
**For people who gained access to my two knowledge source private repositories**:
* https://bitbucket.org/kotaro_sakamoto/worldhistoryindriindex
* https://bitbucket.org/kotaro_sakamoto/worldhistoryindriindex-englishversion

**Note: I cannot give everyone access to the repositories.** Accessible people is very limited because of a license issue and I do not explain it more here. If you cannot gain access to the repositories, you have to create knowledge sources by yourself.

In default settings of [reference.conf](https://github.com/ktr-skmt/FelisCatusZero-multilingual/blob/master/src/main/resources/reference.conf), Japanese knowledge source is located in ~/wh and English knowledge source is located in ~/whe.
If you have access to the knowledge source repositories, you can git-clone the knowledge sources via HTTPS/SSH and install them in ~/wh and ~/whe.

## Git-clone via HTTPS and install the Knowledge Source
Do as [downloadKS-HTTPS.sh](https://github.com/ktr-skmt/FelisCatusZero-multilingual/blob/master/tutorial/script/downloadKS-HTTPS.sh) or do as below
```bash
wget https://github.com/ktr-skmt/FelisCatusZero-multilingual/blob/master/tutorial/script/downloadKS-HTTPS.sh
bash downladKS-HTTPS.sh
```

## Git-clone via SSH and install the Knowledge Source
Do as [downloadKS-SSH.sh](https://github.com/ktr-skmt/FelisCatusZero-multilingual/blob/master/tutorial/script/downloadKS-SSH.sh) or do as below
```bash
wget https://github.com/ktr-skmt/FelisCatusZero-multilingual/blob/master/tutorial/script/downloadKS-SSH.sh
bash downloadKS-SSH.sh
```
